# Robotic Manipulation and Machine Learning Test (Yuhang's Group)


Welcome to the coding test for evaluating applicants' skills in robotic manipulation and machine learning. In this test, you will be tasked with controlling a robot arm in a Pybullet simulation to move a small cube to a target position.

## Objective

Your primary objective is to develop an algorithm that enables the robot arm to pick up a cube and place it at a specified target position in the least number of moves, while ensuring accuracy and stability.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Python programming.
- Basic understanding of robotic manipulation concepts.
- Experience with optimization or machine learning algorithms, especially reinforcement learning is a plus.
- Knowledge of Pybullet or similar robotic simulation tools.

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [URL of this repo]
   
2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install pybullet
   
## Task Details

1. **Environment Setup**: 
   - Familiarize yourself with the Pybullet environment provided in the `environment.py` file. This file contains the basic setup for the robot arm and the cube.

2. **Algorithm Development**: 
   - Develop your algorithm in the `environment.py` file. You can use any machine learning or control algorithm of your choice.

3. **Evaluation**: 
   - Your solution will be evaluated based on:
     - **Efficiency**: Number of moves taken to move the cube to the target.
     - **Accuracy**: How close the cube is placed to the target position.
     - **Stability**: The robot arm should not exhibit erratic or unstable behavior.

## Submission

Once you've developed your solution, compress your project into a zip file and send it to [yuhang.hu@columbia.edu](mailto:yuhang.hu@columbia.edu).
## Resources

- [Pybullet Documentation](https://pybullet.org/)
- [Reinforcement Learning Basics](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/reinforcement-q-learning-scratch-python-openai-gym/)

## Tips

- Start with a simple control algorithm before diving into complex machine learning models.
- Visualize the robot's movements to understand its behavior better.
- Regularly test your algorithm to ensure it meets the evaluation criteria.

## Conclusion

We're excited to see your approach to this challenge! Remember, the journey is as important as the destination. We're not just looking for a working solution, but also your problem-solving approach, code organization, and clarity.

Good luck!
